# DoomHUD

Just [read the blogpost for now](https://blog.clauswitt.com/doomhud-an-adventure-in-agentic-coding/) ; and I will (maybe?) update this project with a real readme for at some point. 

If you are truly adventurous - you can grab a release from: https://github.com/clauswitt/doomhud/releases
